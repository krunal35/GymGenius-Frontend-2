          Yoga traces its roots back to ancient India, where it emerged as a
          holistic system for achieving physical, mental, and spiritual
          well-being. The earliest mentions of yoga can be found in the Vedas,
          ancient scriptures dating back to around 1500 BCE. During the
          Classical Period, the sage Patanjali codified yoga philosophy into the
          Yoga Sutras, outlining the Eight Limbs of Yoga as a guide for ethical
          living and spiritual practice. Other influential texts like the
          Bhagavad Gita further expounded on yoga's principles, introducing
          concepts like karma yoga and bhakti yoga. Over the centuries, yoga
          evolved and spread throughout India and beyond, experiencing a
          resurgence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the help of
          Indian spiritual leaders. Today, yoga is practiced globally, adapting
          to diverse lifestyles and preferences while remaining deeply rooted in
          its ancient origins, offering practitioners a path to holistic
          well-being and self-discovery.</v-card-text
