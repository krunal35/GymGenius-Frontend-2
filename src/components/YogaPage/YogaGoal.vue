          The ultimate goals of yoga are stilling the mind and gaining insight,
          resting in detached awareness, and liberation from saṃsāra and duḥkha:
          a process (or discipline) leading to unity with the divine (Brahman)
          or with one's self. This goal varies by philosophical or theological
          system. In the classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of
          yoga is to achieve samadhi and remain in that state as pure awareness.
          According to Knut A. Jacobsen, yoga has five principal meanings: A
          disciplined method for attaining a goal Techniques of controlling the
          body and mind A name of a school or system of philosophy With prefixes
          such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in
          particular yoga techniques The goal of yoga practice</v-card-text
