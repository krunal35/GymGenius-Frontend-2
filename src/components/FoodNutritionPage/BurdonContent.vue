          Most recent estimates show that globally, 149.2 million children under
          the age of 5 years of age are stunted (too short for their age) and
          45.4 million are wasted (underweight for their height). The number of
          children with stunting is declining in all regions except Africa. Over
          three-quarters of all children suffering from severe wasting live in
          Asia. Around 45% of deaths among children under 5 years of age are
          linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income
          countries. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that
          particularly affects young children and pregnant women. WHO estimates
          that 40% of children less than 5 years of age and 37% of pregnant
          women worldwide are anaemic. Thirty percent of women of reproductive
          age have anaemia. Globally, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese
          and 38.9 million children under 5 years of age are overweight. Rates
          of childhood overweight and obesity are rising, particularly in
          high-income and upper-middle-income countries. Although breastfeeding
          protects against undernutrition and overweight, only 44% of infants
          under 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed. High sodium
          consumption (>5 g salt/day) contributes to high blood pressure and
          increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people consume
          too much salt – on average 9–12 grams per day, or around twice the
          recommended maximum level of intake.</v-card-text
