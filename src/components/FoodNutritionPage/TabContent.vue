          Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better
          nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health,
          stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of
          non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular
          disease), and longevity. Healthy children learn better. People with
          adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to
          gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger. Malnutrition, in
          every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the
          world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both
          undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income
          countries. There are multiple forms of malnutrition, including
          undernutrition (wasting or stunting), inadequate vitamins or minerals,
          overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable
          diseases. The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of
          the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting for
          individuals and their families, for communities and for
          countries.</v-card-text
